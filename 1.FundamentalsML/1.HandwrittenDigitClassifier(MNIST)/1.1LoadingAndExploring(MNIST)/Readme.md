## Objetive:
Make sure you understand your data well and that there are no surprises before moving on to modeling

* 1.Understand your data before training any model 
    - Know what you're dealing with: images of handwritten digits
    - Understand how many examples there are, how many classes there are and how many examples per class

* 2.Identify potential problems:
    - The balanced of the dataset
        - If a class has too few examples, the model may not learn to recognize it well 

* 3.Familiarize yourself with the structure of the data:
    - See that each image is sized (8x8 or 28x28)
    - Visually observe some images to verify that the data makes sense(that it's not corrupted)

* 4.Foundation for future steps:
    - Before applying models or transformations, it's always recommended to understand the distribution of the data

    - This allows for informed decisions, such as performing data augmentation if you see that there are few images of certain digits

## Results 
The bar you see in the graph generated by this code is a histogram that represents the distrubution of examples by class in the MNIST dataset (8x8 version)

Each  bar corresponds to a digit from 0 to 9, and the height of the bar indicates how many images of that digit are in the dataset.

It is used to verify that the data is balanced (that there is a similar number of images for each number) or to detect if any class has very few examples, which could affect the performance of your modeel.

The program is designed to show the dimensions (x, y) of the dataset, the classes it has, and the number of examples per class.
