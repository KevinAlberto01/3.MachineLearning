## Objetive:
Make sure you understand your data well and that there are no surprises before moving on to modeling

* 1.Understand your data before training any model 
    - Know what you're dealing with: images of handwritten digits
    - Understand how many examples there are, how many classes there are and how many examples per class

* 2.Identify potential problems:
    - The balanced of the dataset
        - If a class has too few examples, the model may not learn to recognize it well 

* 3.Familiarize yourself with the structure of the data:
    - See that each image is sized (8x8 or 28x28)
    - Visually observe some images to verify that the data makes sense(that it's not corrupted)

* 4.Foundation for future steps:
    - Before applying models or transformations, it's always recommended to understand the distribution of the data

    - This allows for informed decisions, such as performing data augmentation if you see that there are few images of certain digits

## Results 
The bar you see in the graph generated by this code is a histogram that represents the distrubution of examples by class in the MNIST dataset (8x8 version)

| <p align = "left"> Each  bar corresponds to a digit from 0 to 9, and the height of the bar indicates how many images of that digit are in the dataset. <br> It is used to verify that the data is balanced (that there is a similar number of images for each number) or to detect if any class has very few examples, which could affect the performance of your modeel.| <img src = "https://github.com/KevinAlberto01/3.MachineLearning/blob/main/1.FundamentalsML/1.HandwrittenDigitClassifier(MNIST)/1.1LoadingAndExploring(MNIST)/Images/Histogram.png" width="4000"/>|

The program is designed to show the dimensions (x, y) of the dataset, the classes it has, and the number of examples per class.

## Program explication   

|Pseudocode| Image of the program|
|----------|---------------------|
**NumPy:** Used to work with arrays and matrices, and it has functions for mathematics and statistics <br> **Pandas:** Used to manipulate and analyze data, particularly with DataFrames (tables of rows and columns).<br> **matplotlib.pyplot:** Used to create graphs, and pyplot is specifically for generating different types of plots (e.g., bar, line, scatter).<br> **load_digits from sklearn.datasets:** Used to load a dataset of handwritten digits, which is commonly used in classification projects.| <img src = "https://github.com/KevinAlberto01/3.MachineLearning/blob/main/1.FundamentalsML/1.HandwrittenDigitClassifier(MNIST)/1.1LoadingAndExploring(MNIST)/Images/1.DeclareteLibraries.png" width="4000"/>|
**`digits`:** loads a dataset of handwritten digit images, where you find images of numbers 0 to 9 in black and white, each with 8x8 pixels. Each image represents a number (digit) and has a label indicating which number it is. <br> **`x`:** Contains images (numeric format), for each 8x8 image it is flattened into a 64 array, each value represents the pixel intensity (0 = black, 16 = white). <br> **`y`:** contains the labels (real numbers of the images), each element is a number from 0 to , representing which digit each image is| <img src = "https://github.com/KevinAlberto01/3.MachineLearning/blob/main/1.FundamentalsML/1.HandwrittenDigitClassifier(MNIST)/1.1LoadingAndExploring(MNIST)/Images/2.LoadDataset.png" width="4000"/>|
**`x.shape`:** Returns the dimension of x(1797, 64), it has 1797 images, and each image has 64 values (8x8 pixels). <br> **`y.shape`:** Returns the dimension of y (1797), there are 1797 labels per image, each label is the number it represents (0-9).|<img src = "https://github.com/KevinAlberto01/3.MachineLearning/blob/main/1.FundamentalsML/1.HandwrittenDigitClassifier(MNIST)/1.1LoadingAndExploring(MNIST)/Images/3.ExploringDimensionsDataSet.png" width="4000"/>|
**`clases`:** Contains the unique values of y(0-9) <br> **`count_classes`:** Array that indicates how many examples there are of each class | <img src = "https://github.com/KevinAlberto01/3.MachineLearning/blob/main/1.FundamentalsML/1.HandwrittenDigitClassifier(MNIST)/1.1LoadingAndExploring(MNIST)/Images/4.CheckClassesNumberExamples.png" width="4000"/>|
**`plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))`:** Set the size of the figure (8 wide and 5 high) <br> **`plt.bar(clases, count_classes, color='skyblue')`:** Create the bar chart, the list that contains the number of examples, assign the color of the bars. <br> **`plt.xlabel('Digit')`:** Set the x-axis label <br> **`plt.ylabel('Number of examples')`:** Set the y-axis label <br> **`plt.title('Distribution of the classes')`:** Add a title to the chart. <br> **`plt.show()`:** Visualize the graph | <img src = "https://github.com/KevinAlberto01/3.MachineLearning/blob/main/1.FundamentalsML/1.HandwrittenDigitClassifier(MNIST)/1.1LoadingAndExploring(MNIST)/Images/5.ViewDistributionClasses" width="4000"/>|
**`fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 5, figsize=(10, 5))`:** Create a figure and a grid (2 rows and 5 columns) totaling 10 subplots, set the size (10, 5 in inches)  10 wide and 5 high <br> **`fig.suptitle("Examples of images")`:** Establish a general title <br> **`for i, ax in enumerate(axes.ravel())`:** Iterates through each of the subplots, converts the (2x5) matrix into a one-dimensional array, which makes individual access easier, and returns both the index `i` and the `ax` object in each iteration. <br> **`ax.imshow(x[i].reshape(8,8), cmap='gray')`:** it is a vector image from the dataset.  resize to an 8x8 matrix, apply a grayscale <br> **`ax.set_title(f"label: {y[i]}")`:** Assign a title to each subplot. <br> **`ax.axis('off')`:** Deactivate the axes so that the marks or values do not appear. <br> **`plt.show()`:** Show the subplots and images. | <img src = "https://github.com/KevinAlberto01/3.MachineLearning/blob/main/1.FundamentalsML/1.HandwrittenDigitClassifier(MNIST)/1.1LoadingAndExploring(MNIST)/Images/6.ViewExample.png" width="4000"/>|
