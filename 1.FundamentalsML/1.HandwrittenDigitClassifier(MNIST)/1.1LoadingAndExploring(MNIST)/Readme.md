## Objetive:
Make sure you understand your data well and that there are no surprises before moving on to modeling

* 1.Understand your data before training any model 
    - Know what you're dealing with: images of handwritten digits
    - Understand how many examples there are, how many classes there are and how many examples per class

* 2.Identify potential problems:
    - The balanced of the dataset
        - If a class has too few examples, the model may not learn to recognize it well 

* 3.Familiarize yourself with the structure of the data:
    - See that each image is sized (8x8 or 28x28)
    - Visually observe some images to verify that the data makes sense(that it's not corrupted)

* 4.Foundation for future steps:
    - Before applying models or transformations, it's always recommended to understand the distribution of the data

    - This allows for informed decisions, such as performing data augmentation if you see that there are few images of certain digits
