Develop a classification model capable of correctly predicting the digit present in each image using Machine Learning algorithms.
## Description
Handwriting recognition is one of the most common applications of Machine Learning and Computer Vision. This problem consists of building a classification model capable of recognizing handwritten digits (from 0 to 9) from grayscale images.

Skill: Logistic regression and simple neural networks.
Description: Use Scikit-learn or TensorFlow to classify digits from the MNIST dataset.
Extra: Implement the model from scratch without advanced frameworks.

To do this, we will use the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset, a widely used dataset in the field of Machine Learning. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, where each image is 28x28 pixels and represents a number from 0 to 9.
