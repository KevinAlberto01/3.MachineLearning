1. Handwritten Digits Classifier (MNIST)
Skill: Logistic regression and simple neural networks.
Description: Use Scikit-learn or TensorFlow to classify digits from the MNIST dataset.
Extra: Implement the model from scratch without advanced frameworks.


Problem Description
Handwriting recognition is one of the most common applications of Machine Learning and Computer Vision. This problem consists of building a classification model capable of recognizing handwritten digits (from 0 to 9) from grayscale images.

To do this, we will use the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset, a widely used dataset in the field of Machine Learning. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, where each image is 28x28 pixels and represents a number from 0 to 9.

Objective
Develop a classification model capable of correctly predicting the digit present in each image using Machine Learning algorithms.

Tasks to be Performed
Loading and exploring the MNIST dataset to understand the distribution of the data.
Data preprocessing, including pixel normalization and conversion of images to vectors.
Training a Machine Learning model using algorithms such as:
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Neural Networks (MLP or CNN)
Evaluating the model with metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.
Optimizing performance, testing techniques such as hyperparameter tuning or data augmentation.
