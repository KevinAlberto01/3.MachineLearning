Transform the raw data into a format that is more suitable for the model to learn patterns more quickly and accurately.

* **1.Normalization / Standardization**
    - Scale the pixel values to be in a more uniform range
        - Mean 0 and variance 1 with StandardScaler, or between 0 and 1 by dividing by 255
    - This makes the training more stable and faster, and improves the performance of some models.

* **2.Conversion to vectors**
    - Since each image is 8x8, it is flattened into a vector of 64 values so that the model can work with it. 
    - Many traditional machine learning models (logistic regression, SVM, KNN) expect the input data to be vectors (not matrices or images).

View the original images to confirm that the data you are using is reasonable and makes sense.

| <p align = "left"> It's just a way to check that you are working with real images of handwritten digits. <br> It doesn't matter that the data is internally normalized, the images always look like digits because imshow() knows how to interpret the matrices as images.| <img src = "https://github.com/KevinAlberto01/3.MachineLearning/blob/main/1.FundamentalsML/1.HandwrittenDigitClassifier(MNIST)/1.2DataPreprocessing/Images/Results.png" width="4000"/>|

Check the normalized numerical values to ensure that the preprocessing was done correctly.

| <p align = "left"> **Negative values** represent pixels that are below average. <br> <br> Positive values represent pixels that are above the average. <br> <br> Values close to 0 represent pixels with an average value.| <img src = "https://github.com/KevinAlberto01/3.MachineLearning/blob/main/1.FundamentalsML/1.HandwrittenDigitClassifier(MNIST)/1.2DataPreprocessing/Images/DataNormalized.png" width="500"/>|

**NumPy:** Used to work with arrays and matrices, and it has functions for mathematics and statistics <br> **Pandas:** Used to manipulate and analyze data, particularly with DataFrames (tables of rows and columns).<br> **matplotlib.pyplot:** Used to create graphs, and pyplot is specifically for generating different types of plots (e.g., bar, line, scatter).<br> **load_digits from sklearn.datasets:** Used to load a dataset of handwritten digits, which is commonly used in classification projects.<br> **sklearn.preproccessing.StandardScaler:** Normalize the data | <img src = "https://github.com/KevinAlberto01/3.MachineLearning/blob/main/1.FundamentalsML/1.HandwrittenDigitClassifier(MNIST)/1.2DataPreprocessing/Images/1.ImportLibraries.png" width="4000"/>|
Load the digits dataset that comes with scikit-learn, it contains images of handwritten digits of 8x8 pixels. <br> **`digits.data`:** it contains the images, but each image is in the form of a vector of 64 elements (8x8). <br> **`digits.target`:** Contains the labels of the digits (0-9). | <img src = "https://github.com/KevinAlberto01/3.MachineLearning/blob/main/1.FundamentalsML/1.HandwrittenDigitClassifier(MNIST)/1.2DataPreprocessing/Images/2.LoadData.png" width="4000"/>|
Create a figure with 1 row and 5 columns to display 5 images. <br> Take the first 5 images (`x[0]`, `x[1]`, ...) <br> **`x[i]`:** is converted from a vector to an 8x8 matrix with `reshape(8, 8)`. <br> **`cmap=gray`:** the images are displayed in grayscale.<br> **`ax.set_title`:** Hide the axes <br> **`plt.show()`:** Show the images|<img src = "https://github.com/KevinAlberto01/3.MachineLearning/blob/main/1.FundamentalsML/1.HandwrittenDigitClassifier(MNIST)/1.2DataPreprocessing/Images/3.ShowImages.png" width="4000"/>|
Normalize the data using StandardScaler() from sklearn,it makes the data have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, it is important for Machine Learning algorithms to work better. <br> **`scaler.fit_transform()`:** Calculates the mean and standard deviation of x and transforms the data <br> **`x_scaled`:** Now it contains the normalized data.| <img src = "https://github.com/KevinAlberto01/3.MachineLearning/blob/main/1.FundamentalsML/1.HandwrittenDigitClassifier(MNIST)/1.2DataPreprocessing/Images/4.NormalizationStandard.png" width="4000"/>|
Print the first 5 rows of the normalized data.<br>Each row still represents an 8x8 image, but the values are now normalized floating-point numbers (mean 0, standard deviation 1).| <img src = "https://github.com/KevinAlberto01/3.MachineLearning/blob/main/1.FundamentalsML/1.HandwrittenDigitClassifier(MNIST)/1.2DataPreprocessing/Images/5.ShowFirstRows.png" width="4000"/>|
