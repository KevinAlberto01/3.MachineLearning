    <h1 align = "Center"> 2.Decision Tree Regressor</h1>
</p>

Implements a DecisionTreeRegressor model to predict the price of houses, applying data preprocessing techniques such as feature engineering, scaling with RobustScaler and data augmentation with jittering (Gaussian noise).

The evaluation of the model allows comparing its performance on training and test data, helping to detect overfitting if the model has a very high R² in training but low in testing.
