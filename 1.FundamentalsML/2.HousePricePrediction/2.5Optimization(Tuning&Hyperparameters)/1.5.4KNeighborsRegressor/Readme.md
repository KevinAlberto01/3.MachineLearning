</p>
Implements a regression model based on K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to predict house prices. A dataset is loaded, preprocessed by converting categorical variables to numerical variables and split into training and test data. Then, GridSearchCV is used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model by testing different values of number of neighbors and weighting methods. Finally, the model is evaluated using metrics such as RMSE (root mean square error) and R² to measure its accuracy.
