The search for the best hyperparameters for 4 key models (**Linear, Trees, Forests, and KNN**), comparing them and visualizing their metrics to identify the optimal model for predicting SalePrice.
Perform hyperparameter optimization for 4 regression models and evaluate which configuration offers the best balance between accuracy (R¬≤) and error (RMSE) when predicting house prices (SalePrice). The approach is to compare multiple combinations of hyperparameters to improve the performance of each model.

* **1.Data Loading and Preparation** 
    - Load the cleaned dataset (AmesHousing_cleaned.csv).
    - Separate Features (X) and Target (y).
    - Apply get_dummies() to convert categorical variables.
    - Scale the variables with StandardScaler or RobustScaler, as appropriate.
    - Divide the dataset into train and test (80%-20%).

* **2.Models and Methods of Optimization**
    - The program optimizes and compares the following models:
        - LinearRegression
            - Simple linear regression (without hyperparameters, only serves as a baseline).
        - DecisionTreeRegressor
            - Decision tree with depth and criteria optimization.
        - RandomForestRegressor
            - Tree ensemble (Random Forest) with optimization of the number of trees and depth.
        - KNeighborsRegressor
            - K-nearest neighbors (KNN) regressor optimizing the number of neighbors and metrics.

* **3.Evaluated Metrics**
    - For each combination of hyperparameters, the following metrics are calculated:
        - Train RMSE
            - Root mean square error on the training set.
        - Test RMSE
            - Root mean square error on the test set.
        - Train R¬≤
            - Coefficient of determination in the training set.
        - Test R¬≤
            - Coefficient of determination in the test set.
    - These metrics are key to evaluating accuracy and detecting overfitting or underfitting.
        

* **4.Results Record**
    - The results are stored in a DataFrame called df_results.
    - This DataFrame is sorted and saved in a CSV file.
    - It is used to consult and analyze the best hyperparameters found for each model.

* **5.Graphical Comparison**
    - Two comparative charts are generated using matplotlib:
    - Comparison of RMSE
        - Bar chart comparing the error (Train/Test) of each model.
    - Comparison of R¬≤
        - Bar chart comparing the accuracy (Train/Test) of each model.
    - These visualizations allow you to quickly identify which model is more accurate and which suffers from overfitting or underfitting.

Is the result of **`df['saleprice']. describe()`**, which provides key statistics about the variable saleprice (the sale price of the houses).

|<p align = "left"> **`count` (2930)** ‚Üí  It is the number of records in the **`saleprice`** column.  That is to say, you have data on 2930 houses. <br> **`mean` (180,796.06)** ‚Üí It is the average selling price of the houses. <br> **`std` (79,886.69)** ‚Üí It is the standard deviation, which indicates how much the prices vary from the average. <br> **`min` (12,789)** ‚Üí It is the lowest recorded selling price. <br> **`25%` (129,500)** ‚Üí It is the first quartile.  It means that 25% of the houses have a price less than or equal to $129,500. <br> **`50%` (160,000)** ‚Üí It is the median.  Half of the houses cost less than $160,000 and the other half more. <br> **`75%` (213,500)** ‚Üí It is the third quartile.  75% of the houses cost less than or equal to $213,500. <br> **`max` (755,000)** ‚Üí It is the highest recorded selling price.|<img src = "https://github.com/KevinAlberto01/3.MachineLearning/blob/main/1.FundamentalsML/2.HousePricePrediction/2.5Optimization(Tuning%26Hyperparameters)/Images/SummarySalePrice.png" width="4000"/>|
|----------|---------------------|

The prices are very dispersed (large difference between minimum and maximum).
The median ($160,000) is lower than the average ($180,796), which suggests that there are some houses with very high prices that are skewing the average upwards.
There could be outliers, especially if a few houses have extremely high or low prices.

</p>

|<p align = "left">It is recommended to use RobustScaler instead of StandardScaler because there are high values in X, indicating the possible presence of outliers. <br> RobustScaler will help ensure that the scaling is not affected by these extreme values. |<img src = "https://github.com/KevinAlberto01/3.MachineLearning/blob/main/1.FundamentalsML/2.HousePricePrediction/2.5Optimization(Tuning%26Hyperparameters)/Images/Results.png" width="4000"/>|

<p align = "center" >
    <h4 align = "Center">4.log1p(yes) vs log1p(no) </h4>
</p>

If the values of **`SalePrice`** are very dispersed or have a large difference between low and high prices, this transformation helps to: 
* **Reduce the variability** of the data, preventing extreme values from dominating the model. 
* **Make the distribution more normal (symmetric)**, which improves the accuracy of some Machine Learning algorithms.

**When to answer ‚Äúy‚Äù (yes)**
* If house prices have a very skewed distribution to the right (long tail with very high values).
* If the models are not working well because high values are affecting the calculations too much.

**When to answer ‚Äún‚Äù (no)**
* If SalePrice already has a distribution close to normal.
* If you prefer to work with the original values without modifications.

    <h4 align = "Center">Model Interpretation </h4>
</p>

**Linear Regression** 
* Good overall performance with a Test_R2 of 0.845 (84.5% of variance explained).
* The difference between Train_RMSE (18786) and Test_RMSE (35230) suggests that the model may not generalize perfectly.

**Decision Tree**
* Train_RMSE of 0 and Train_R2 of 1.0 ‚Üí the model memorizes the data perfectly (overfitting).
* Test_RMSE of 35128 indicates that on new data it does not perform as well.
* Test_MAE of 24304 suggests large errors in new predictions.

**Random Forest.**
* Best model overall:
    * Test_R2 of 0.909 (explains 90.9% of variability).
    * Test_RMSE of 26993, the lowest of all models.
    * Test_MAE of 16029, the lowest absolute error after Linear Regression.
    * Seems to strike a good balance between accuracy and generalization.

**KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors).**
* Worst model:
    * Test_R2 of 0.697, the lowest (poor generalization).
    * Test_RMSE of 49282, the highest (highest error).
    * Test_MAE of 28889, the worst in absolute error.
    * KNN does not seem to be a good choice for this problem.

**1. Train RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):**
Error metric indicating the average difference between predicted and actual values.
>[!TIP]
>The lower the RMSE, the better the model is at predicting. 

**2. RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) test:**
Measures the error in the test set (data that were not used to train the model). 
A higher value in the test set compared to the training set may indicate that the model has some overfitting.
>[!TIP]
>The model fits the training data very well but does not generalize as well to new data.

**3. Train R¬≤ (R-squared):**
Measure of the goodness of fit of the model. A value close to 1 indicates that the model explains a large proportion of the variability of the output variable. 
>[!TIP]
>The Train R¬≤ of 0.9783 is excellent, which means that the model explains almost 98% of the variability in house prices in the training data.

**4. R¬≤ test (R-squared):**
Indicates how well the model predicts the values in the test set. An R¬≤ of 0.9125 suggests that the model is still very good at predicting prices in the test data.
>[!TIP]
>The difference between Train R¬≤ and Test R¬≤ is somewhat normal, as generally the model fits the training data better than the test data, but this value is still very good.

**5. Train MAE (Mean Absolute Error):**
Is the mean absolute error between the actual and predicted values. It is a measure of the magnitude of the error without considering its direction. 
>[!TIP]
>A Train MAE of 6,476.53 means that, on average, the model predictions deviate from the actual values by 6,476.53 units of the target variable.

**6. MAE (Mean Absolute Error) test:**
The predictions in the test set deviate more than in the training set, with an average error of 15,842.78. 
>[!TIP]
>This higher value suggests that the model has more difficulty predicting the values in the test data, which is expected in many cases due to the variability of the data.


>[!NOTE]
>The optimized **Random Forest model** seems to be a very good choice for predicting house prices, but there is always the opportunity to improve it further by tweaking the model or using other techniques such as feature engineering
