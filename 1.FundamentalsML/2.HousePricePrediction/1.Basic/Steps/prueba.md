# üè† House Price Prediction with Machine Learning

üåê This README is available in: [English](README.md) | [Espa√±ol](README.es.md)

A regression project to predict housing prices based on multiple features such as size, quality, and location. The final goal is to build an interpretable and optimized model with a clean data science pipeline.

## 1. üìå Introduction

This project aims to develop a robust regression model to estimate the price of a house using publicly available data. A clean pipeline was built from scratch using Python and scikit-learn, and the process was documented for learning purposes.
