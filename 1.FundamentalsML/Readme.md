These projects are designed to develop a solid understanding of key concepts in Machine Learning, covering everything from data manipulation to model implementation and evaluation.  
The projects include: 
* **Handwritten Digit Classifier (MNIST)**
* **House Price Prediction**
* **Sentiment Analysis (Movie Reviews)**
>[!NOTE]
>Each focusing on different aspects of machine learning.
