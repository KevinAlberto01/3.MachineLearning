This roadmap is designed to develop skills in solid Machine Learning projects, master key concepts, and establish an adaptable foundation for future advanced projects.

* Understand the complete flow of a Machine Learning project, from data loading to final evaluation. 
* Learn best practices in feature engineering, normalization, and optimization to improve model performance. 
* Explore and compare multiple algorithms in regression and classification problems. 
* Implement techniques of Data Augmentation to strengthen the model's generalization capability. 
* Facilitate the documentation and presentation of results through graphs, metrics, and an organized workflow.
