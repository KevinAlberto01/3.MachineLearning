</p>

This roadmap is designed to **develop skills** in solid **Machine Learning projects**, master key concepts, and establish an adaptable foundation for future advanced projects.

* Understand the **complete flow** of a Machine Learning project, from data loading to final evaluation. 
* Learn best practices in **feature engineering**, **normalization**, and **optimization** to improve model performance. 
* Explore and compare **multiple algorithms** in regression and classification problems. 
* Implement **techniques of Data Augmentation** to strengthen the model's generalization capability. 
* **Facilitate the documentation** and **presentation** of results through graphs, metrics, and an organized workflow.

The Proyects are structured so that each step is independent, allowing: 

* **Easily identify** which improvements have the **most impact**.
* **Test different combinations** of techniques without losing control of the process.
* Develop confidence in the **critical analysis** of results.
