<h2 id="description" align="center">📜 Description 📜</h2>

In this folder, you will find all my projects focused 100% on Machine Learning. The main idea is to be in constant improvement and learning more to become an expert in this type of projects.

<h2 id="0-roadmap" align="center">0. Roadmap</h2>

Without having deep knowledge of the subject, I decided to start with a roadmap located in the first folder.

After that, I will gradually upload more projects, starting with the basics. For now, I am working on my roadmap but will progressively add other projects.

In this folder (0.Roadmap) you will find subfolders:

- ML Fundamentals  
- Deep Learning & Neural Networks  
- Advanced Application & AI Production  

<h3 id="01-ml-fundamentals" align="center">0.1 ML Fundamentals</h3>

This folder includes three basic projects designed to develop the logic and working style necessary in machine learning. The goal is to establish an orderly and controlled methodology that allows following each step of the process in a structured way.

<h4 id="012-house-price-prediction" align="center">0.1.2 House Price Prediction</h4>

This project was important because it allowed me to work with a real database in .csv format (compatible with Excel), which helped me understand how to extract, process, and use real data in a machine learning environment.
