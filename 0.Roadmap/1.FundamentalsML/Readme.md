<h2 id="description" align="center">📜 Description 📜</h2>

This section is designed to build a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts of Machine Learning. It covers everything from data manipulation and preparation to basic model implementation and evaluation.

The included projects allow for practical application of these concepts to establish the foundation for a complete data science workflow.

The projects included in this stage are:

- **Handwritten Digit Classifier (MNIST)**  
  A classification model to recognize handwritten digits using supervised learning techniques.

- **House Price Prediction**  
  A regression model that estimates property values based on structural and locational features.

- **Sentiment Analysis (Movie Reviews)**  
  A classification model that identifies sentiment (positive or negative) in movie reviews using natural language processing.

Each of these projects is designed to strengthen essential skills in ML model development, result interpretation, and building reproducible workflows.

>[!NOTE]  
>Each one is focused on different aspects of machine learning.

<h2 id="mnist" align="center">1. Handwritten Digit Classifier (MNIST)</h2>

<h4 id="objectives1" align="center">🎯 Objectives 🎯</h4>

Develop a classification model that recognizes handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

<h4 id="focus1" align="center">🔎 Focus 🔎</h4>

Image classification and handling of visual data using techniques such as data augmentation and hyperparameter optimization.

<h4 id="results1" align="center">✅ Results ✅</h4>

<h2 id="houses" align="center">2. House Price Prediction</h2>

<h4 id="objectives2" align="center">🎯 Objectives 🎯</h4>

Predict the value of residential properties based on multiple features such as number of rooms, quality, size, location, and year of construction.  
The goal is to build a reliable model that generalizes well to new data.

<h4 id="focus2" align="center">🔎 Focus 🔎</h4>

Implementation of regression algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, and LightGBM).  
Feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization techniques were applied to improve performance and model interpretability.

<h4 id="results2" align="center">✅ Results ✅</h4>

A robust predictive model was achieved with high R² and low RMSE on the test data.  
The project was developed in three stages: a basic version with initial models, an advanced version with feature engineering and optimization, and finally a deployment stage.  
In the final stage, an interactive dashboard was built using Streamlit, allowing users to input new data and visualize predictions in real time.
