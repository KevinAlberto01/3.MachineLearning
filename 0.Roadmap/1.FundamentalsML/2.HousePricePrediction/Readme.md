<h2 id="description" align="center">📜 Description 📜</h2>

This project aims to predict house sale prices using Machine Learning techniques, based on a dataset that includes multiple property features such as size, location, material quality, among others.

To approach this problem progressively, three implementation levels were developed—from a basic version to a production-ready solution:

<h2 id="level1" align="center">Level 1 – Basic Model</h2>

In this first version, the focus is on loading, cleaning, and performing preliminary analysis of the dataset, as well as training simple models to establish a prediction baseline.  
Additionally, a basic dashboard was built using Streamlit to allow interactive data and results visualization, helping users explore variable behavior and better understand the dataset.

<h2 id="level2" align="center">Level 2 – Advanced Model</h2>

This version incorporates more sophisticated techniques such as Feature Engineering and Data Augmentation to improve dataset quality.  
It also includes hyperparameter optimization and an in-depth comparison between advanced models to select the most accurate and generalizable one.

<h2 id="level3" align="center">Level 3 – Model Deployment</h2>

This stage consists of building a robust interactive dashboard using Streamlit. Unlike previous stages, this version allows the user to:

- Enter new data manually or by uploading files.  
- Get real-time predictions.  
- View graphs and metrics in a clear and intuitive way.  

It is also cloud-ready, making it accessible from any device without running local code.

<h2 id="objectives2" align="center">🎯 Objectives 🎯</h2>

- Accurately predict house sale prices using Machine Learning models trained with real data and multiple relevant property variables.  
- Apply a full data science workflow, including data exploration, cleaning, evaluation, optimization, and model deployment.  
- Develop scalable versions of the project, starting from a basic analysis to a fully deployed solution for end users.  
- Implement interactive visualizations to facilitate data understanding, model interpretation, and results exploration.  
- Build a cloud-hosted web application that allows anyone to predict house prices in real time without technical knowledge.
