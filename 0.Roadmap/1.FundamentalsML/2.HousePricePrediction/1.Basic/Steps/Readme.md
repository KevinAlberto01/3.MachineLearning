<h2 id="descripcion" align="center">üìú Description üìú</h2>

This is a basic regression project implementing a full Machine Learning pipeline (excluding the data augmentation step) to predict house prices. The model considers key features such as quality, size, and location, using historical real estate market data.

Each step is explained below to show the logic used to solve the problem.

<h2 id="desarollo" align="center">Development Process</h2>

    <td style="width: 50%; vertical-align: top; text-align: left; padding-right: 20px;">
      The development process of this project follows a logical step-by-step structure to build a robust and interpretable regression model. <br>
      We begin by loading and cleaning the data, followed by an exploratory analysis to better understand the variables and their impact on price. <br>
      Then, multiple algorithms are trained to compare their performance using appropriate metrics. <br>
      For evaluation, we use these metrics to compare and select the best-performing model. <br>
      Afterwards, we optimize the selected model to achieve better results and predictions. <br>
      We then integrate the entire workflow into a single robust program. <br>
      Finally, predictions are made using the trained model and results are displayed in an interactive dashboard.

<h3 id="desarollo" align="center">1.1 Data Processing</h3>

<h4 id="Cdatos" align="center">1.1.1 Data Loading</h4>

In the first step, we loaded the Ames Housing dataset, obtaining a total of 2,930 rows and 82 columns.  
This provides a rich and detailed base of features describing the properties, including aspects such as size, quality, location, and more.

<img src="https://github.com/KevinAlberto01/3.MachineLearning/blob/main/0.Roadmap/1.FundamentalsML/2.HousePricePrediction/1.Basic/Steps/Img/1.dataProcessing/1.1.1.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Dashboard Preview" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" />

> [!NOTE]  
> This stage is crucial to get a general overview of the dataset, identify potential errors or missing data, and plan the next cleaning and analysis steps.

<h4 id="Nvalues" align="center">1.1.2 Check for Null Values</h4>

We checked for null values present in the dataset. At this stage, we only performed a visual inspection to understand the structure of our database, without making decisions yet on which variables to remove or keep.  
This helps us better understand the quality and completeness of the data before proceeding with analysis.

<h4 id="Dduplicados" align="center">1.1.3 Duplicate Data Detection and Data Type Analysis</h4>

In this step, we combined two important tasks: first, we detected duplicate data to ensure dataset quality; second, we analyzed the data types.  
This is essential for planning future processes, as each variable may require different treatment based on its type.

<h3 id="eda" align="center">1.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>

<h4 id="heatmap" align="center">1.2.1 Heatmap</h4>

First, we created a heatmap of the entire dataset to visualize which variables show relationships with each other. However, due to the large amount of data, the chart does not allow for clear visualization. Therefore, in the next step, we filtered and focused the analysis on the most relevant variables for better interpretation.

<img src="https://github.com/KevinAlberto01/3.MachineLearning/blob/main/0.Roadmap/1.FundamentalsML/2.HousePricePrediction/1.Basic/Steps/Img/2.EDA/2.1.1.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Data types" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">

Next, we printed the most relevant variables to generate a reduced heatmap. The goal is to get a better view and understanding of the relationships between the most influential variables in this specific case.

Finally, we used the most relevant variables to generate a reduced heatmap, where we observed that the first two variables show the highest correlation (darker color intensity). This is useful because these variables may be modified or used to improve the model in the next steps.

<h4 id="pairplot" align="center">1.2.2 Pairplot</h4>

In this step, a pairplot is used to visualize the behavior of the selected variables. Since we have identified two variables with high correlation, it is important to observe their distribution and visual relationship to better understand how they interact.

<h4 id="desc" align="center">1.2.3 Descriptive Statistics</h4>

Based on the selected variables (Gr Liv Area and Overall Qual), we obtain more detailed information about their relationships with the rest of the dataset. However, it is important to remember that SalePrice is our target variable (y), as our main goal is to predict its behavior.

<img src="https://github.com/KevinAlberto01/3.MachineLearning/blob/main/0.Roadmap/1.FundamentalsML/2.HousePricePrediction/1.Basic/Steps/Img/2.EDA/2.1.5.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Data types" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">

<h4 id="histo" align="center">1.2.4 Histograms</h4>

This step helps us visualize the distribution of each variable's data. Through histograms, we can:

- Detect the shape of the distribution (normal, skewed, etc.).
- Identify possible biases and outliers.
- Assess whether a variable requires transformation (such as log or scaling).
- Observe the general distribution across numerical variables.
- Make decisions about preprocessing that could improve model performance.

This visualization is key to better understanding our data before building predictive models.

|Distribution of Gr Liv Area|Distribution of SalePrice|Distribution of Overall Quality|
|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|

>[!IMPORTANT]
>In the next step, we will observe the behavior and combinations of each variable if selected, but we haven‚Äôt made any selections yet.

|SalePrice and Gr Liv Area|SalePrice and Overall Qual|SalePrice, Gr Liv Area, Overall Qual|
|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------| 
|Both variables show skewed distributions and contain extreme outliers. Therefore, it is recommended to use MinMaxScaler, as it is safer to preserve the original scale without being affected by these outliers. <br> Alternatively, StandardScaler can also be used, but keep in mind that outliers can significantly influence the mean and standard deviation, affecting the scaling.| SalePrice is a continuous variable, while Overall Qual is an ordinal variable with values from 1 to 10 representing quality. <br> Normalizing Overall Qual is not necessary, as it is a discrete number with specific meaning. Therefore, scaling could be applied only to SalePrice using MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler.| MinMaxScaler is a safe option if we want all variables in the [0, 1] range. <br> StandardScaler may be useful if Gr Liv Area and SalePrice follow a normal distribution. <br> However, Overall Qual is an ordinal variable, so it is advisable to leave it unscaled to preserve its meaning.|

<h4 id="boxplot" align="center">1.2.5 Boxplot</h4>

A boxplot is a graphical representation that shows the distribution of a numerical variable, highlighting its median, quartiles, and possible outliers.<br>
It allows us to quickly and visually identify dispersion, symmetry, and the presence of extreme values.<br><br>

<h5 id="saleprice" align="center">1.2.5.1 Boxplot SalePrice</h5>

We observed several points above the interquartile range, indicating the presence of high outliers. This suggests that there are homes with significantly higher prices than the dataset average.

<h5 id="grlivarea" align="center">1.2.5.2 Boxplot Gr Liv Area</h5>

The Gr Liv Area boxplot also shows the presence of high outliers, with the upper whiskers extending further than in other cases, indicating that some homes have significantly larger living areas than the typical range.

<h5 id="overallqual" align="center">1.2.5.3 Boxplot OverallQual</h5>

The OverallQual boxplot shows values mainly concentrated below the median, with few or no visible outliers, indicating that most homes have a general quality within a limited range.

<img src="https://github.com/KevinAlberto01/3.MachineLearning/blob/main/0.Roadmap/1.FundamentalsML/2.HousePricePrediction/1.Basic/Steps/Img/2.EDA/2.3.3.jpeg?raw=true" alt="Data types" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"> <br>

Finally, we analyzed the p-value to assess the statistical significance of our variables in relation to the target variable (SalePrice).

<h4 id="distribucion" align="center">1.2.6 Data Distribution</h4>

We need to calculate the skewness of each variable to quantify how skewed its distribution is, which is important for deciding what preprocessing actions to take.
After calculating skewness, we observed that Gr Liv Area and Overall Qual have positive skewness, meaning most values are low, but a few high values skew the distribution.

Next, we filtered rows where any variable had a value less than or equal to 0, as in real-world data such values should not exist (e.g., negative area or price makes no sense). This check helps detect errors or inconsistencies in the data before training the model.

Finally, and importantly, we rechecked for null values, but this time only in the variables we actually care about for the model. This helps us focus preprocessing efforts on relevant columns and make informed decisions about handling missing data.
